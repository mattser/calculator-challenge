### By Mateusz Seredyn
<br />

About
=====
As the name implies, this repo contains the code for a browser based JavaScript calculator.
All code was indepedently developed by the author to complete the following: Easy to read code,
which has some complexity and is somewhat object oriented. 
<br />
* The project UI is made in HTML and CSS (SCSS).
* Underlying Engine is made in JavaScript.
* All interactions on the page are done via DOM.
<br />
<br />

Functionality
=============
The calculator can be used as such. It can take multiple input values, and then perform calculations.
Do note operations can occur as follows:
* A calculation can occur every time the "=" is pressed, updating the answer
* Or a running calculation can occur everytime an operator is selected.
This allows you to chain calculation, much like you would do on a real calculator.
<br /> Total Features / Operations Includes:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Clearing The Whole Calculator
* Backspacing an element
* Calculations with decimals
* Toggling the Working Value to and from a negative value.
